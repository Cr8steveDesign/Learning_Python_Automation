# Introduction to Lists in Python 

# Lists constants are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas. 

#A List element can be any Python object - even another list. A list can equally be empty

# Lists are mutable and passed by reference to functions. If you want to modify a list without affecting the original, use the .copy() method or use the slice notation [:] you can specify start and end positions

# You can split a string into a list string.split()
#You can join a list by appending the separator wihth the method
# ".".join(mylist)


import swapfunction

# swap_array = swapfunction 

mylist = [13, 15, 8, 5]

print(mylist)
